The Food Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution designed to ensure food safety and quality by continuously monitoring environmental conditions. The system uses temperature, humidity, and methane sensors to track the storage environment of perishable goods. The collected data is transmitted to a central server where it can be analyzed, logged, and acted upon if certain thresholds are breached.
